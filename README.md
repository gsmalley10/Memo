Memo turns your macOS menu bar into a running task list — no Dock icon, no window to manage, just a click away whenever you need it. Add tasks, set a priority, give them a due date, drag to reorder, and check them off with a sound and a satisfying tick. Decide what happens to finished items — keep them in place, send them to the bottom, or hide them on completion — and pick the menu bar icon and counter that fit how you like to work.

## Installation

Download the latest `.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/LaluIman/Memo/releases), open it, and drag **Memo** into Applications.

Memo isn't notarized, so macOS Gatekeeper will block it the first time you open it. To allow it:

1. Double-click **Memo.app** — you'll see *"Memo.app" Not Opened*. Click **Done**.
2. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll down to the **Security** section.
3. Find *"Memo.app" was blocked to protect your Mac* and click **Open Anyway**, then confirm with your password or Touch ID.
4. Open **Memo.app** again — a final confirmation dialog appears. Click **Open**.

This is only needed once, for this initial install.

**Note:** On that first open, macOS may run a one-time security scan on the new binary, and you might briefly see *"Memo.app" is not responding"*. This isn't a crash — just wait a few seconds and open it again; it'll launch normally from then on.

Prefer to build it yourself instead? Clone the repo and hit **Run** in Xcode (⌘R) — it's signed with your own Apple ID during the build, so it launches immediately with no security warnings.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LaluIman/Memo.git
cd Memo
open "Memo Todo App.xcodeproj"
```

**Requirements:**
- macOS 27 Golden Gate or later
- Apple Silicon
- (Building from source) Xcode 26 or later, with a free Apple ID signed in (Xcode → Settings → Accounts)
